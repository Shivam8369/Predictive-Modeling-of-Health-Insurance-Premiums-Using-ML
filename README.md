# Predictive Modeling of Health Insurance Premiums Using ML


## Introduction
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can estimate the medical insurance costs for individuals based on their age, gender, BMI, smoking status, and other related factors. The dataset used in this project contains information about medical insurance costs for a group of people based on the factors.

We used Linear Regression model to calculate the health insurance premiums. 

## The Success of Linear Regression Model: approx(75%)  

## Testing it
